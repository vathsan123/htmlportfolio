<h3>1.LEO</h3>
<P>Parthiban "Parthi" is an animal rescuer and a café owner in Theog, Himachal Pradesh living with his wife Sathya and two children Siddharth "Siddhu" and daughter Mathi "Chintu". One day, Parthi's friend Joshy Andrews, a forest ranger, calls him to help tame a spotted hyena threatening the townsfolk. With Siddhu's help, Parthi manages to tranquilise the hyena and purposely avoids public attention over this incident. He adopts the hyena after it calms down and names it as Subramani.</P>

 <p> One night, Parthi and Chintu are at the café when a robber named Shanmugham and his men arrive to rob the cafe. One of the gang members makes a move on his employee Shruthi and Parthi thrashes all of them. When one of them attempts to kill Chintu, Parthi guns all of them down without hesitation, but later has an emotional breakdown. Initially arrested, Parthi is released for having committed the murders in self-defense, but his photograph appears in newspapers all over India. One such image is seen by a notorious gangster Harold Das in Telangana, who informs his elder brother Antony Das about him. Antony immediately leaves with his men for Theog.</p>
    
 <p>Meanwhile, Shanmugham's relatives attempt to kill Parthi and his family, prompting him to request a high-ranking, armed police officer from Tamil Nadu to be sent to his house for protection. Parthi's request is granted as Napoleon, having been promoted recently following his heroics with Dilli in Tiruchirappalli,[a] is assigned to protect his family.<br /><p> On meeting Parthi, Antony alleges that Parthi is his son Leo Das, who was presumed to be dead, but Parthi vehemently denies this. Antony threatens him to accept his identity and surrender or face the consequences. Antony meets Sathya and tells her that Leo is a mass murderer, prompting her to dig into Parthi's past. At the same time, Joshy starts digging into Leo's past and learns about his friend Hridayaraj D'Souza, who was arrested and is to be hanged in three days. On meeting with Hridayaraj, Joshy learns about Leo's past.</p>
    
 <p>In 1999, Antony established a tobacco factory called Das & Co. Harold returned to India from Canada and started manufacturing and smuggling datura using the factory as a front as their tobacco products did not take off. Antony's twin children Leo and Elisa Das did the dirty work for them to run the business smoothly.<br/> <p> Being a strong believer in the occult, Antony tried to sacrifice Elisa based on his astrologer's advice as this would have allowed their tobacco products to take off. Enraged, Leo set fire to all of Harold's drugs, but Harold managed to kill Elisa and Antony shot Leo, who was since presumed to be dead.</p>
    
 <p>On hearing this, Joshy is convinced that Parthi is not Leo, while Sathya also gets definitive proof of the same. Meanwhile, Antony kidnaps Siddhu and tells him that he will sacrifice Siddhu as he could not sacrifice Elisa with his own hands. Parthi and Napoleon chases after Antony and his men. Parthi eventually catches up with them and finishes off Antony and his men, but does not find Siddhu.<br /><p>Harold learns about Antony's death and calls Parthi to bring Antony's body in return for Siddhu. As Parthi goes to Harold's lair, Harold reveals that he has sent men to kill Sathya and Chintu. However, Napoleon, Joshy and Subramani finishes off all the men. Harold's men attack Parthi at their lair, but he manages to fend them off. As Harold and Parthi engage in a fistfight, Parthi grabs a gun and holds Harold at gunpoint.</p>
    
 <p>At this point, Harold admits that Parthi is not Leo and states that he and his family can walk away freely. However, Parthi starts laughing and finally admits that he is actually Leo before gunning down Harold, rescuing Siddhu and torching the entire Das & Co. factory. Leo states that he has done nothing good in his past and anyone who insists on knowing his story must either die or already be dead.</p><p> After returning to his peaceful life, Parthi gets a phone call. The caller reveals that he knows Parthi's identity as Leo and tells him that destroying his family's datura factory was not enough to make the society drug-free as drugs are rampant all over India. The caller also tells that he knows Parthi recognises his identity as Parthi sighs in exasperation.[b]</P>

 <h3>2.VIKRAM</h3>
 
 <P>Police Chief Jose summons Amar and his black-ops team to bring justice to a group of masked vigilantes responsible for the deaths of Stephen Raj (recently released following his arrest three months earlier for helping gangsters Adaikalam and Anbu),[a] ACP Prabhanjan and his foster father Karnan. Amar leads the investigation by digging into Karnan's life as his murder seems out of place because Karnan was an ordinary man, while the other two were high officials in the NCB.

    Amar learns about Karnan's recent addiction to alcohol, drugs, and prostitutes, and that he was very protective of his infant foster grandson. Amar also finds out about two missing containers of narcotics. Sandhanam, who runs a much bigger drug syndicate than Adaikalam, named Vetti Vagaiyara, is searching for the containers. His cold-blooded smuggler boss, 'Rolex', whose identity is unknown, was meant to receive the containers.</P><p> Furthermore, Amar learns that Rolex would help Sandhanam form his government if the drugs were delivered. Otherwise, Rolex will kill Sandhanam and his family. Amar slowly figures out that all of Karnan's addictions were a ruse to cover up a highly covert operation he had been running.
    
    Meanwhile, Veerapandian, a PWD officer, and a contractor named Rudra Prathap plan to bring the drug containers to Sandhanam. However, the masked vigilantes arrive and kill Veerapandian at a theatre. Amar and his team capture one of the vigilantes, revealed to be Bejoy.</p><p> Bejoy reveals his family was killed for his role in leading the Trichy drug bust [a], leading him to join the vigilantes. Amar and his team realise Rudra Prathap is the next target, and they sneak into Rudra Prathap's daughter's wedding ceremony. Rudra Prathap invites Sandhanam for protection. However, the masked men, along with their leader arrive at Rudra Prathap's daughter's wedding and threaten him. The leader drags Rudra Prathap and escapes on a bike, leaving the other members to deal with Sandhanam, but Sandhanam defeats them.
    
    Amar chases the leader down, who is revealed to be Karnan, having faked his death. Karnan kills Rudra Prathap by slitting his throat and escapes the police. Amar reveals to Jose that Karnan is actually Vikram, the former commander of the black ops squad's pilot batch of 1986.</p><P> After a botched mission, the government hunted and brutally killed all squad members and their families; only Vikram and three other team members survived. Amar also figures that Jose is Sandhanam's mole in the department and is involved in Prabhanjan's death. Amar orchestrates a bomb blast at Sandhanam's house, which destroys his bungalow and drug lab. Jose gets wind of this and informs Sandhanam in the nick of time. Everyone except Sandhanam's brother Elango is evacuated from the blast site in time. Jose reveals Vikram and Amar's identities to Sandhanam.</P>
    
  <P></P>  Vikram arrives at the prison and frees Bejoy and his team. Vikram reveals that the reason for actions is not vengeance over Prabhanjan's death but a mission to bust the drug syndicate in the city. He also admits that Prabhanjan is his own biological son and that Prabhanjan was aware of his identity as Vikram.</P><P> Sandhanam murders Amar's wife Gayathri and sends his men to attack and kill Vikram's daughter-in-law and grandson at Prabhanjan's house. Vikram rushes to save them, but the gang kills a team member of Vikram's black ops squad, Agent Tina, who was disguised as the house help Valiamma. Jose is killed by a vengeful Amar. Vikram and his grandson reach Chennai Port, where the hidden containers are stored. Sandhanam learns about the containers' location and attacks Vikram. Vikram mows down Sandhanam's men with a cannon and an M2 Browning, but the remaining members of his black ops squad, Agents Uppiliappan and Lawrence die in the scuffle. After a fistfight with Sandhanam, Vikram triggers a huge blast at the port that kills Sandhanam and destroys the drug containers.</P>

      In an epilogue, in Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, Adaikalam and Anbu arrive with their men. They meet up with the gangsters affiliated with Sandhanam for a meeting with Rolex. Adaikalam and Anbu explain Dilli's involvement in the Trichy drug ambush [a], and Sandhanam's men reveal Vikram and Amar's involvement in destroying their drug syndicate. It is shown that Amar joins Vikram's gang after Gayathri's funeral in Ernakulam to continue the fight against drugs. Anbu informs Rolex that Dilli is currently hiding somewhere in Uttar Pradesh while Sandhanam's men tell him that Vikram's family is somewhere abroad (shown to be San Francisco). Rolex announces a massive bounty for the execution of Amar, Dilli, and Vikram's team. Unknown to everybody else, Vikram is also present at the meeting and walks away with determination after learning about the bounty placed on all of them.</P>

In a ruse to bring Rocky to Adheera, Andrews kills Desai to lure Reena outside K.G.F, and John abducts Reena as per Adheera's order. While trying to save Reena, Adheera shoots Rocky but spares his life, while his men roadblock all gold exports from K.G.F.

    A recuperated Rocky, along with Reena, visits Dubai to deal in gold with Khalil, and also buys Kalashnikovs from him. Rocky and his gang gravely wound Adheera and kill his henchmen with their newly acquired weapons. Exasperated with K.G.F, some central ministers had planned a no-confidence motion against the DYSS-supported government to bring Ramika Sen in power, but Rocky's henchmen threaten other ministers against the vote and the motion fails. Rocky also kills Shetty, gaining control over Bombay. Pandian warns Rocky of Sen's rising stature, but he disregards him.</p>

Just as Reena reveals her pregnancy to Rocky, Adheera fatally shoots her.
    
    In the ensuing clash, Rocky's army kill Andrews and Daya, while Rocky kills John and chokes Adheera to death. Rocky and his henchmen disrupt Sen's speech at the Parliament and kill Pandian (who had staged the attack on Garuda for which Adheera was framed, and informed Adheera of Garuda's attack priorly.
